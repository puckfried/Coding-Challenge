# Little coding challenge

In this repo you find a text file. This text file contains of lines of charaacters, in every line you find numbers, try to read the file line by line and always take the first digit and the last digit and form a 2 number digit out of it. At the end make sum of all the 2 digit numbers.

For example:
```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
